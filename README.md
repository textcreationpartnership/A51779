#####Body#####

1. Exportation of Wooll Deſtructive to this Kingdom.

    _ To the firſt I Anſwer.

    _ To the ſecond Reaſon; That it will occaſion the Rates of wooll to riſe, and thereby ſuſtain our drooping Rents, &c.I Anſwer.

    _ To the third Reaſon for repealing our Laws; That our Neighbours with the help of our people get great quantities of our wooll
daily from us notwithſtanding thoſe Laws to the contrary.I Anſwer.

    _ To the fourth reaſon,That 'tis to ſmall purpoſe to keep our wooll at home, for that Ireland ſupplies our Neighbours therewith, &c. I Anſwer.

    _ To the laſt reaſon, that the prohibition of wooll is a new practice unknown to us till within this twenty years, and yet before that time both Wooll and Drapery yielded the beſt Rates, for above 60 years laſt paſt.I Anſwer.

    _ I have lately met with one Merchant of no ſmall pretences to the intrigues of Trade, who, although he will not allow that the Rates of wooll may encreaſe upon the repeal of our Lawes, (which is the prime reaſon alleadged for repeal of the prohibition) yet affirms that if the prohibition were remov'd and due Impoſts charg'd upon wooll, it might thereby, better than by the prohibition, be either retain'd at home, or rendred ſo chargeable to our Neighbours that we might have ſufficient advantages over them in that Manufacture.
To which, I anſwer.

    _ If, to what has been ſaid, it be reply'd that it is better export wooll, then neither wooll nor Drapery. I Rejoyn.

    _ If I be ask'd what we ſhall do with our wooll ſeeing its Exportation is of ſuch dreadfull conſequence, and our Drapery ſo neglected at home, I Anſwer.

    _ I therefore humbly propoſe.
